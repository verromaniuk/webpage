<a style="color: white;"> Born in Kyiv, Ukraine, I attended an international school and applied to university in New York. I was always fond of mathematics and curious about physics, but I applied to study cinema, which at the time I had developed a passion for studying on my own time. Then, my vision shifted towards Psychology, as I sought to learn more about the human psyche and the range of human experience. I studied also sociology and philosophy, and formed a philosophical field of interest which I self-titled Fractal Psychology. I has lucky to also study some programs for visual creation, such as P5js, Resolume, Touchdesigner, and landing on Unity as a tool for further application in collaborative experiences. From a young age I enjoyed lerning software, teaching myself video editing and equiring excellent Power Point skills at a young age. Coding, learning the intricacies of software has aways been a welcome challenge to my mathematics-loving mind. Unity allowed me to unite my passion for coding with a love for interacting with artists and creating shared collaborative experiences. The next step of light design comes naturally as it also fuses these two together in the creation of collaborative magival experience, with a detail-oriented knowledge of software and imminent trouble-shooting and problem solving. </a>
